This is a simple personality quiz made in Python. I may update it with more varied responses and outputs in the future.

To run the program, make sure you have Python installed on your computer. Then download the file # Personality Quiz in Python.py from this repository and run it in Python.

To do list: 

  -Create more detailed personality descriptions.
  -Show other personality traits in addition to the answer for specific combined traits.
  -Display the total personality scores as a graph.
